- Make video/audio files smaller and still working

- Make portrait view have the current part as well as a next part / previous part button

- Handle video and audio syncronization - make program wait if needed

- Make optional tutorial (screen with two big buttons, "Tutorial" or "I know what I'm doing")
	- "click to change instruments" while one instrument is playing.
	- "add more instruments" to add two more instruments
	- "Change song parts"
