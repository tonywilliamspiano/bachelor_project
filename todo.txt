1. Make a controlling function for play_audio, so that play_audio doesn't have to do so much work on its own. 
	- controlling function called 'setupSongPart(songPart) which takes the song part from the button and handles the rest.
	- Play Audio should return when it is done, and the ended flag can be used to know whether to start the next part. 
	- If the audio is done, make a 'switchGIFs' function to put the next ones up on screen.
		- switchGIFs can dynamically change the source path for all of the gifs I need so I can keep the same logic throughout!
	- Also handle playVideo() from within the script.js file. 

2. Catch exception (or whatever it is called) if the GIF is not found and just do nothing!

3. Add all parts, videos and GIFs to the array so it runs beginning to end.  

4. Add a pause button and functionality

5. Make buttons on the bottom for all parts of the song







- Version control so that the states of the arrays are always saved
